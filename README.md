### Structure Design Principles

-   Organized by **platform or vendor first**
-   Then separated by **solution category**
-   Each solution directory may contain:
    -   Script or configuration files
    -   Example configuration
    -   Solution-specific README.md
    -   Optional INSTALLATION.md

This ensures scalability as the repository grows.
